Puzzle Platformer
Elements of humour

Concept:
You save people by carrying them all, specifically on your back,  
while traversing dangerous and puzzling terrain. The people you carry will limit what terrain 
you can cross, limiting movement up and down walls (maybe?) or the ability to walk under small spaces.
The weight of citizens could also potentially be used as another form of puzzle element, 
being used to weigh down elevated platforms and levers to open paths forward.

Systems required by current scope (May or may not be in order of use and necessity): 
- Collision
- Sprite rendering
- Basic Physics (weight and movement based off a gravity modifier)
- Sprite dithering
